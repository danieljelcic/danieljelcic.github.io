            I was born in 1998 in Bosnia and Herzegovina, or what used to be Yugoslavia until just a couple of years before my arrival. My birth was probably the biggest event in the contemporary history of the nation and was welcomed with unanimous excitement and great expectations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Just kidding - no one was too excited about my coming to existence, including myself. It was the most normal thing, and so was the majority of my childhood and teenage-hood. I would, in fact, say that my life had and has been a pretty flat line with occasional peaks of excitement and change, most of which have happened over the past 5 years or so.
        </p>
        <p>    
            Probably the first exciting thing that had ever happened to me was when I got my first computer in 2009 - this clunky, custom built desktop behemoth that ran 8 times slower than my current smartphone does but that could still do everything I ever wanted, really. It let me make videos, edit photos, write useless-but-mildly-entertaining websites, and then after a couple of years it let me make floor plans in CAD, animated 3D models in Cinema4D and logo designs in Illustrator. My passion for technology and digital design overtook all of my other passions, and soon thereafter I was quite sure I wanted to study Computer Science.
        </p>
        <p>    
            Certainly one of the most exciting things to happen to me was in 2014 when I got an offer to attend the United World College in Mostar where I lived with people from 60 different countries, learned about what it means to be a globally oriented active citizen and entrepreneur and decided that my world at the time was too small for me.
        </p>
        <p>    
            That led me in to my next exciting thing, the first one fully of my own initiative, which was interning at school in Thailand for a semester. There I got to attend important meetings with important people, create cool things and publish them on the school's official media channels and lead student teams for a variety of community-oriented things. I also learned how to use chopsticks, I learned that Thailand is about 543 years ahead of everyone else and that it is, in fact, a bad idea to ride a motorcycle without a licence.
        </p>
        <p>    
            Ever since then, I've been living my longest, most consistent, most mature excitement peak in Boston, MA at Tufts University, where I arrived in 2017. Every day, I get to live my dream to study Computer Science and make computer graphics for a variety of campus groups, I get to explore the ideas and challenges of global relevance and I get to explore an unfamiliar place and culture.
        </p>
        <p>    
            Right now... I'm writing this very bio, of course. But beyond that, I am looking for a brand new burst of excitement in my life, be it academic, professional or purely adventurous. If you think we could think up / make / do something exciting together, please don't spare me the knowledge of it and reach out to me at <a href="mailto:daniel.jelcic@tufts.edu">daniel.jelcic@tufts.edu</a>. I will be impatiently waiting.
