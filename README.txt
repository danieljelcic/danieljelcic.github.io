Assignment 1: Your Portfolio

I feel confident most if not all aspects of the assigment specified in the
assignment specification have been fully implemented. I used the basic
proposed structure of HTML pages, all of which have a navigation bar
that allows access to all three of them at any time. I used one CSS file
in which I defined a global style for the website and individual styles for
certain page-specific elements using class and child CSS selectors.

This assigment took approximately 6 hours to complete.
